# Websites

You already know this. 

```
site:stackoverflow.com "interface"
```


Or other site

```
site:somesite.com "interface"
```

# Github

I generally try to use `path` parameter to narrow. For example, for Typescript - `path:*.ts`. 

Sometimes some code snippets could be found in issues and discussions.

# Gitter

Some libraries use `gitter`, where people share their code snippets.
