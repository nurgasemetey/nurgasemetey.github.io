As Linux user who had to switch to OS X because of work, I experienced considerable discomfort while switching from Linux.

# Window management

## Linux

In Linux Mint Cinnamon at least, I would easily tile windows using keyboard shortcuts `Super`+`Left`, `Super`+`Right`, `Super`+`Left`, `Super`+`Up` in same workspace.

I would easily move window to another workspace again using keyboard shortcuts.

Also using [Devilspie2](https://www.nongnu.org/devilspie2/ "Devilspie2"), I could limit apps to certain workspaces.



## OS X

Currently, I feel pain because I need to use trackpad and drag windows to another workspace. Although [Rectangle](https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle "rxhanson/Rectangle: Move and resize windows on macOS with keyboard shortcuts and snap areas") somehow helps in tiling windows to some extent.

Another painful moment is maximize button behavior(it creates new workspace). 

I constanly `alt-tabbing` to find my apps. No need to mention that there is no separate icon for multiple instances of same app. I use [AltTab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos) which brings Windows and Linux alt-tab behavior.



# Terminal and nano

Terminal and Iterm 2 don't support moving cursors word by word by default like in Linux using `Ctrl` + `Right` or `Ctrl`+`Left` . For that you need to go options and change settings.

`nano` also does not support same behaviour.



# File management

You can't add some app to recommended list for opening files. It is especially needed when you want to open some `kt`, `js` or `.cpp` file using `Sublime Text`. OS X does not allow intuitive adding unless you must use `Automator` or go to app's `plist` , edit it and run some command to link. As workaround, I open terminal and run `cat` command to see contents of file.



# Launchers

Yes, it has Alfred or Raycast but I don't want to buy Alfred and be locked to it. For example, Ulauncher is free and has much more plugins compared to Raycast. 

Use cases

- I can add current song in Spotify to favourites without going to app. I couldn't find such behaviour in Raycast.
- I can copy to clipboard various timestamp formats. Again I couldn't find such behaviour in Raycast.
